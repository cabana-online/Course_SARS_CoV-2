## Summary

Continuous analysis of SARS-CoV-2 allows monitoring the virus spread, understanding how it is evolving over time, and facilitating the implementation of effective public health measures. This course aims to provide an introduction to bioinformatics through the analysis of genomic data of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this course, viral genomes obtained through different types of sequencing will be analyzed, the different lineages of virus variants will be determined, and you will learn how to share this data with the rest of the world.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply command-line tools for quality control of sequence data.
- Identify the formats of files commonly used in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.
- Use Pangolin for viral lineage identification from existing datasets.


## Target Audience

The course is aimed at students, researchers, or clinical/healthcare professionals. No prior bioinformatics skills are required.

## General Requirements

The course will use Google Colaboratory, which is free but requires a Google account for use. Google accounts are free.


## Program

 
### Module 1: [Introduction to Google Colaboratory](01.Intro_a_colab.ipynb).

Modules 1, 2, and 3 are located in the repository  [Introduction](https://github.com/cabana-online/Introduction_tutorial)

To get started, go to https://colab.research.google.com/.

On the Colab home page, select "File" and then "Open notebook". 

There's a tab for "GitHub"; select that tab and paste the following URL into the search bar under "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user":

`https://github.com/cabana-online/Course_SARS_CoV-2`

After a brief search, you'll see the notebook:

`01.Intro_a_colab.ipynb`

Select it, and you'll see the notebook open.

To run the cells, you'll need to sign in with your Google account (feel free to create one). Using Colab is free.

**Note:** There are limitations in the free version, but they won't be reached in this course.
